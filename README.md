# PapermergeJS

PapermergeJS is frontend part i.e. web-based user interface of Papermerge
Document Management System. It is meant to be used in conjunction with
[Papermerge REST API backend server](https://github.com/papermerge/papermerge-core).


## What is Papermerge DMS?

Papermerge is an open source document management system (DMS) designed
for **digital archives**. Instead of having piles of paper documents all over
your desk, office or drawers - you can quickly scan them and configure your
scanner to directly upload to Papermerge DMS.

## What is a Digital Archive?

Simply put a digital archive is a scanned document. In broader sense, digital
archives are documents whose content does not change in time; a good example of
such **documents are PDF files**. If you take a picture of a document, you'll end
up with a "scanned document" in png, jpeg or whatever format that picture is
stored. In context of papermerge a picture of a document made with you mobile
phone is also a digital archive.

Papermerge **supports pdf, jpeg, png and tiff** file formats.
